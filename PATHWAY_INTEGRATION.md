# Pathway Integration for Financial AI Responses

## Overview
This project now integrates Pathway's real-time data processing capabilities to enhance the AI responses in the financial application. Pathway provides stream processing functionality that can be used to analyze market data, news, and other real-time information.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Pathway Integration (pathway_integration.py)**
   - Connects Pathway pipelines with the application's data sources
   - Provides fallback mechanisms when Pathway is not available

2. **Pathway Pipelines (pathway_pipelines.py)**
   - Defines data processing pipelines for market data and news
   - Creates persistent output that can be consumed by AI models

3. **Enhanced AI Responses (trading_buddy_ai.py)**
   - Integrates Pathway's processed data into AI prompts
   - Improves response quality with data-backed insights
   - Supports both Gemini and OpenAI models

### Data Flow

1. Real-time data is collected from various sources (APIs, WebSockets)
2. Pathway pipelines process and analyze this data
3. Processed data is saved to JSON files for consumption
4. AI models use this processed data to generate more informed responses

## Usage

The system automatically attempts to use Pathway if it's available. To ensure Pathway is properly utilized:

1. Make sure Pathway is installed (`pathway` is included in requirements.txt)
2. Set proper environment variables for AI models (OPENAI_API_KEY or GOOGLE_API_KEY)
3. Start the application with `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

## Output Data

Pathway generates processed data files in the `/data` directory:
- `market_output.jsonl`: Processed market data
- `news_output.jsonl`: Processed news with sentiment analysis

## Further Improvements

1. Implement more sophisticated Pathway pipelines for:
   - Anomaly detection
   - Trend analysis
   - Correlation calculations
   - Real-time portfolio optimization

2. Extend AI integration:
   - Use Pathway's machine learning capabilities
   - Implement custom models within Pathway
   - Provide real-time visualizations of processed data
